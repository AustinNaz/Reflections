How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	it gave an easier way to view and compare the 2 files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	you could try alternative methods of changing parts in code while reusing old code without having to re-type it

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	the pros you will be able to understand the changes in the code better also where to roll back to incase of a problem,
	cons would be it might get convoluted and confusing to read if you commit to often.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	because git tracks several files while docs only tracks individual files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will tell you the different commits and then with git diff you can compare the differences in them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can test different types of code easier without worry since you can just easily go back to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    just hosting code for now
