When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to keep a decentralized back-up of your code or when you are collaberating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So then at any point in time when you specify you will have the most up to date code whether its on your computer locally
    or on Github online.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is a different area that you can do expiremental additions or subtractions to your code without altering the main code.
    A clone is a copy of the code that has no ties to the original.
    a fork is also a copy of the code on Github that has small ties to the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work offline with the latest copy of the code you can get.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
